# [DSA Practice](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iM4uaFzcKByouQhGLRD6puOAUMfhYz9vzWDerWqSnKk/edit#gid=0)

This is a problem set for our Data Structures & Algorithms practice

### Directions
* Create a copy of this template repo
* Clone down the copy
* Open the markdown folder to read the problem for the relevant day
* Select one in your pair to be driver.  They are the only one committing code for this problem.
* The other partner is navigator.  They must tell the driver what to type.
* Work together to solve the problem.  Try to avoid searching for outside sources.

### Requirements
Each project submission must have at least four seperate commits
* One: Summarize the problem in your own words, explaining as clearly as possible
* Two: Write test cases for example inputs and outputs
* Three: Pseudocode your plan in comments
* Four (and above): Commit your code as you go until you solution is complete
