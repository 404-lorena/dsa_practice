# Algorithmic Problem Solving

## Problem Solving
Objectives:
* Demonstrate how a structured approach to problem solving improves technical interview outcomes
* Implement a structured approach to algorithmic problem solving

### Questions:
* What are the essential steps in algorithmic problem solving?
* What do you do if you are unsure how to solve a problem?
* How do you ensure that your approach is valid?
* What tests should you create when preparing to solve a problem?

## Big O
Objectives:
* Analyze solutions to algorithmic problems using Big O Notation 
* Optimize a algorithm for time complexity

### Questions
* What are some examples of Big O notation?  What do they tell you?
* Why is time complexity analysis an important skill in technical interviews?
* What are the limits of Big O notation?  What does Big O not tell you about an algorithm?
* What does it mean to optimize an algorithm?  How do you get started in doing so?
